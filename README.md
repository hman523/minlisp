# Minlisp
## A minimum lisp implementation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/hman523/minlisp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/hman523/minlisp)

This is just for fun, I've been messing around in Rust and want to get better.
Right now it doesn't do much. I'll add features as I go.

The goal is to have the implementation of the interpreter in less than 1000 lines of
Rust, excluding tests and build in functions for the language.
